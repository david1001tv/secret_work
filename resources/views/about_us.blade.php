        <p class="h3 p-40">Choosing a Desktop Computer</p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            In general, desktop computers are known for featuring robust processing chips and larger hard drives. You'll also find a number of ways to configure and upgrade a tower-and-monitor desktop. For these reasons, some of the best gaming computers are desktop PCs. You can also choose from a wide assortment of mice to find your ideal computer mouse.

        <p class="h3 p-40">Shopping for a Laptop PC</p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            MacBooks and PC laptops balance portability with the performance and power you need. To find your ideal laptop, compare the variety of available features. A laptop's size and weight are affected by screen size, the type and capacity of built-in storage devices, and the presence or lack of a CD, DVD or Blu-ray drive. System memory and the power of the processor determine the complexity of software you can run, how many programs you can have open at the same time, and how fast those programs will run.
